## PYTHON :- (PHYTHON 3)

-Object oriented praogramming lamguage
   --Allows to create and use objects and classes easily.
   -- ex:- A variable with whole number is an object of int class.
- Compatibility with different platforms like windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc
- Simple syntax 
- Interpreter based language
-Robust standard libraries 
  -Allows to add functionality to the program without writing additional codes
-Integration with third party module is easy
  ex:- Pyspark (Integration with spartk)
-Open source and huge community support  

## Some of important datatypes in Python are :-
  - Numbers
  - Strings
  - Lists
  - Tuples
  - Set
  - Dictionary

# python code which detect which data type it is :- 

   #Integer data type 
   a = 976 
   type(a) //returns the data-type
   // The datatype stores any numeric values

   #string data type
    //Comprises of set of uni-code charecters which can include a single charecter or multi-charecter

    #List data-type
      The items can be numbers strings
      It contains an ordered sequence of item (sepertated by comma)

    #Tuples 
      -Just like a list, a tuple contains an ordred sequence of items, the only difference is that it cannot be modified
      -it is used to protect the data and usually is fast
      - tuple is defined by parenthesis ()
      - Items in the tuples are right protected

    #Set
     -It is an un-ordered collections of unique items
     -It is composed using curly braces {} and items are seperated by commas
     -The items cannot be fetched using their index numbers

     #Dictionary 
      -It is an un-ordered collection, containning pair of key nd value
      -The key must be unique and can be of di-fferent data type
