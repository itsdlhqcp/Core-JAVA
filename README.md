## JAVA && JAVA_SCRIPT CORE 

In Java basic programming, I learned key concepts like object-oriented programming (OOP), including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
I also gained hands-on experience with core features such as loops, conditionals, arrays, and error handling through exception management.
Additionally, I worked with Java’s standard libraries for tasks like file handling, collections, and multi-threading.

In JavaScript studies, I focused on understanding the language’s core principles, including variables, data types, functions, and DOM manipulation.
I explored advanced topics like asynchronous programming (Promises, async/await), event handling, and ES6+ features like arrow functions, modules 
and template literals, which are essential for modern web development.
